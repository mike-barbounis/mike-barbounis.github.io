## Software

### Text editor

I mostly use an IDE layer for neovim called Lunarvim. VSCode is nice when I need to use some extensions. I'm also a fan of how Helix editor
does things especially how easy it is to configure language servers.

### Programming Languages

For web dev work I always use Javascript unless I have to use something else for a client like PHP.

### Databases

For js backends I always use Postgresql
